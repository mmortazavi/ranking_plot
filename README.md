# Ranking plot

A simple python code for plotting ranking figures using Python (e.g. energy ranking) like the figure that is attached. 

The requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib

The code is using a randomly generated data set (see line: np.random.rand(4,8) * 4 # 4 lines with 8 datapoints from 0 - 4) to demonstrate the usage. The input data can be replaced with any external data, and code can be modified to serve practical purposes.
